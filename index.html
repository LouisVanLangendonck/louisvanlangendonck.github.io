<!-- I am an international student intrigued by AI and Data Science and thus I am  currently doing a Master in Data Science 
            at the Polytechnical University of Barcelona (UPC). I have a Bachelor degree in Physics, during which I have discovered my love
            for rigorous academic research. My goal is to get a PhD in the field of Computer Science. My main interests are oriented towards deep learning and its exciting applications in Natural Language
            Processing and Computer Vision. I made this webpage to keep track of intersting things I have worked on, for now
             mostly of university course projects. If you want to find out more be about me, be sure to take a look at my CV.

                The goal of the project is creating a TBOX, the equivalent of schema definitions for knowledge graphs, 
                creating an ABOX, the corresponding data instances, linking these together and finally querying it. 
                The context considers academical papers and relevant concepts like reviews, journal, and conferences.

                The goal of this project is to try and predict race based on the different categorical and numerical variables available.
                The reason behind this choice is two-fold: Firstly, correlations between variables were assessed 
                and some already insightful results were obtained for some variables in the data set. 
                Secondly, the debate on Race in America has existed since its foundation as a country, and recently has been back in the news again 
                regarding Police brutality claims. There are many studies that have already targeted Police data and found a clear racial bias in some of their actions. 
                This is why it may also be interesting to study further correlations, by looking at how predictive models are able to distinguish the stop and frisk of a Black person, 
                a White person or a person of different origin (i.e. "Black stops" have higher probability than "White stops" at nighttime).
